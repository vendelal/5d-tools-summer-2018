# Designing for the web

Create two projects in Figma:

1. A file creating a mini UI kit/design system containing the following elements:
  * Large header h1
  * Medium header h2
  * Small header h3-h6
  * Normal text p
  * Label or small text label or p class="small"
  * Primary button a class="primary"
  * Secondary button a class="secondary"
  * Link a with 3 versions: normal, hover, active
  * Card div class="card"
2. A completed design using those elements, and more, for your final site design. This should include 4 pages.

Please create a markdown file using the instructions in the video to submit the link to your figma prototype.

This and the rest of your the homeworks while I'm gone are not due until I get back, which gievs you plenty 
of time to complete these designs and the other assignments.
