# Lesson 4 - CSS!

### Building on the example from class, change the following things about your page:

* Change the background color of the body
* Change the font of the h1
* Make some emphasized text bold
* Change the font size of your li elements
* Using HTMl, create three boxes on the page, then use CSS to make them all the same size, but each one have a border with a different color.
* Give the boxes a rounded edge.
