# Flexbox!

1. Complete Flexbox Froggy and upload a screenshot proving that you've completed it. _10pts_

2. Using what you learned about flexbox from class and the game, add flex styles to elements in 
the mock portfolio site to achieve the same layout as the mockup pdf. You do not have to style beyond 
layout, your page will look black and white and Times New Roman, but everything will be in the correct 
place. _15pts_
