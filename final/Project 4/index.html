		<p>I don't have a word to sum up the theme of my work that I have created so far. I think that I'm in the process of discovering what art is. When I was younger, I loved to create. I colored, painted, played with legos. It is something that I have always enjoyed. However back then I thought that art was objects like paintings, drawing, and sculptures. Things that you would see in a art museum. As I grew older I learned of digital design and animation. It was a form that really intrigued me. I liked how it was a process that was applied to everyday life. Creations like posters, websites, and films. Now that I am older I have realized that art is all encompassing. It can be performances, sound or silence, mark making, paintings, or simple lines drawings. It can be analog or digital. It can be still or have motion. It can be flat or three dimensional. Art is not contained to a box of types or a simple standard. And that idea is what best sums up my work so for and the ideas I have for the future. I have done, paintings, drawing, performances, videos, graphic design, sculptures, and animation. Most of these experiences have come from taking classes at my university but I have enjoyed them all and I am thankful that I got the chance to take them. It has to opened my mind to the process of design and experimentation. I have learned to just start and the process will follow no matter the form.</p>

		<p>
		So when someone look at my art I want that someone to not see perfection or skill. I want someone to see trial and possibly error. I want my work to represent my experiments with art, whether it was for class or just for fun. As I move forward I might lean toward some forms more than others but I hope to keep experimenting and discovering. Just like anything else, my art is a work in progress. </p>
