# Your Final!

Your final for this class is to create a personal website. Most of you will be doing a portfolio site, but it can be 
anything you want. We've been talking about this all semester and finally here is a list of requirements!

**Due Date**
**June 26th by 11:59pm EST**

### Grading
This project is worth 115pts. 100 of those points are based on meeting the requirements, and 15 of those points 
are based on whether it's apparent that you put effort and TLC into the project.

### Website Requirements
* 4 HTML pages (if you make an about page (or some sort of extra page) as well 
I’ll count it as 5 extra credit points), and at least 1 css file _10pts_
* All your pages should be linked together (whatever makes sense for your project) _5pts_
* All links should be working properly and create “pretty” URLs (i.e. end in “/“ not “.html”) _10pts_
* Reference the presentation from lesson 3
* At least 3 images (can all be on separate pages) _5pts_
* A navigation that is consistent across all pages _10pts_
* Use flexbox to create your layout _10pts_
* Implement at least one externally hosted font (like a google font) or locally hosted font (using @font-face) _10pts_
* Have at least one media query to make something change when resizing from small screen to large screen _10pts_
* Include at least one change on hover (something like a link changing color would be fine) _10pts_
* Your site must be live using whatever hosting service you prefer (refer to ~future~ lesson 10 for guidance) _10pts_

### What to submit
1. A folder containing: _5pts_
   * The files that make up your website. This should be the same thing you upload to your hosting service.
2. A markdown file containing the link to your live website _5pts_
