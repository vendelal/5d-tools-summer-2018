    <h1>Meaningful/Meaningless Space</h1>

    <p>The task was to spend 1 hour uninterrupted in a meaningful space, and then 1 hour uninterrupted in a meaningless space.  I decided to define meaning in a place as somewhere where something significant had happened. These significant events were held in my mind as memories of a time where I was happy, content, and felt full of life.  One particular moment came to mind that happened in the Boston Commons. I had spent the evening with my friends and we were blissfully happy and joking around on our walk back to Northeastern. It's one of my favorite nights. Therefore, accordingly so, I spent my hour uninterrupted in the Boston Commons. However, as I sat there, I began to notice how everything about my surrounds was different than the image of what I had in my mind. Nothing felt familiar. Nothing carried the same joy as that night. That’s when I came to the realization that it wasn’t the Boston Commons that I found meaningful, it was the memory that I held there. I found meaning within myself, in my own thoughts. It did not matter where I was sitting, all that mattered was that at any point I could resurface that memory from the back of my mind and relive that night and all the emotions that came with it. It didn’t make a difference that I was sitting under a tree. This thought carried me through the development of my project. The poem serves as an intimate look into my own memory. I want viewers to feel as if they have my thoughts in their own mind. Accompanying the writing are photos of my meaningless location, a random T stop. I chose this location simply because I have had made no memories on the T, have not been at any T stop before, and have rarely used public transportation in my life; it was a blank canvas in my mind. While there, I had a similar experience to sitting in the commons. The two locations felt interchangeable. I could imagine the same ideas and feel the same emotions by just thinking about it. The world is simply the background for moments in our life that we deem meaningful. Therefore my photos could have been of anything. The point was to place the reader in a “meaningless” space and then give them something to think about. The abstract and hazy perspective of the photos emphasizes the imaginative, day-dreamy world you can escape to once you begin to get lost in your thoughts. </p>
