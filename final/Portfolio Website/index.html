<h1 style="text-align: center; color: #2F3A44;">ARTIST STATEMENT<h1>

<p>I start by looking for what you can not see. By focusing on the hidden emotions and details that lurk behind the surface of reality, I create pieces which emphasize on the subtleties of everyday life. As a budding artist, I have only a few projects to be proud of. However, my time has just begun and I itching to grow into myself as a creator. I love to think of the world as a place we can recreate through art. That’s why I enjoy photography. The camera can capture the image, but it is how you mold the scene to find new meaning within what you see. I often like to challenge myself to try and take an ordinary setting and find more in the space through the lens.
The process is addicting. My work outside of photography follows a similar theme. Each piece is told from a different point of view: the people around me, the movement, or my own. I find what makes one’s work unique is the perspective in which they present it. I allow this discovery. to lead my creative thinking and ideas. A change of perspective helps us redefine what we thought we knew. Changing, evolving and redirection are pivotal aspects of human growth and without it, we would be nothing but static creatures living in a painful routine. I hope my art will open eyes to see something they didn’t before. I want viewers to leave my space and begin to question how they view their own. I started to view art in this way when I found myself going about life without taking the time to really notice the earth around me. I began to become complacent. Therefore my work is vital for my own mind and I hope to translate that to others, as well.</p>
