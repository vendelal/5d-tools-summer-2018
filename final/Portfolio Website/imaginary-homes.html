    <h1>Imaginary Homes</h1>

    <p>As we grow older, our perception of the world changes. Everything has an agenda. Things rarely exist freely. For this preformance I wanted to target the part of our brains that can easily become overlooked as the years go own. I wanted each person to tap into their creative, imaginative, and youthful selves in order to redefine their idea of home. Given chalk and only ten minutes, I asked each person to draw a new home for themselves in this world, whatever home may look like.</p>
