	<h1>About Erin</h1>
	<div class="container">
		<div class="text-container">
			<p>I am a rising third Year Mechanical Engineering student at Northeastern University with a minor in Experience Design. With this combination, I hope to be able to utilize both my technical skills and my creativity to craft and improve meaningful products and experiences for all types of users. I will soon be beginning my first co-op at Hasbro in Pawtucket, RI where I will work with their animatronics team to develop new toys. I could not be more excited!</p>
			<p>Outside of the classroom, I am very involved in the Society of Women Engineers as publicity chair, and participate in community tutoring through SWE. I am also a Husky Ambassador campus tour guide and a member of Northeaster University Wind Ensemble, where I play the clarinet. </p>
			<p>When I am not doing something in the classroom or on campus, you can find me working on my bullet journal, on a hike, or crocheting a new hat!</p>
