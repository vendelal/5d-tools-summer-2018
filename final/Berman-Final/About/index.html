      <p>Need to know: 5th Year Architecture Student and current co-op at saam architecture.</p>
      <p>Not need to know: The key ideas and goals of my work is to look at life and examine how humans experience the world and how they perceive it compared to how it truly is. I also aim to explore what it means to know the truth, but when I say truth I mean what we say are facts. My interest comes from the way I think in the way I see everything in life connecting. I’m interested in what connects the world to make it either small or large. I choose to ask questions and especially ask questions of things that people may believe to be concrete facts to make people feel unsure but not uncomfortable. I want people to realize there are so many possibilities that we don’t need an answer to all questions. With my work I want to show the beauty in uncertainty and chaos and somehow express the common understanding that can come from bringing yourself and the tension of needing to know everything and the right answers about how life works and why we’re here. Everything I’m interested in exploring or studying is all affected by our understanding of time and I want to take that to add onto the layers of networking that exists and how everything is connected but also keep in mind how it complicates how we understand our world even more. With my work I want to somehow combine multimedia to take people’s lives that exist from both the digital world and in the physical world and combine them to show that it’s all part of our lives and not just separate parts existing individually. I want my work to touch people in a way that makes them feel alive from incorporating elements of every sense and experimenting with how to use different senses. I don’t want my work to be understood exactly the way that I might’ve understood it but instead I want my work to provoke something and other people even if it’s not what I intended or meant or thought of to begin with I want to just either create a reaction. I think that is the whole point of my art, it is to make something that makes something else happen or makes someone think about something else because I think that’s only reason we have to keep creating and making things. The goal is to push forward while also looking at where we were in the past but realizing that the one which matters is where we are right now. </p>
